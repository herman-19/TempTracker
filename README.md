# Temperature Tracker App

This application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS for the front-end, along with a Node.js/Express + MongoDB server and database configuration for the back-end. 

It handles periodic POST requests from a Raspberry Pi to store temperature and humidity data which is displayed in a dynamic line chart to the user. The user is able to subscribe and receive email notifications based on a specified threshold value of interest.
